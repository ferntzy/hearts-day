                  I am just so grateful that we started talking bcs honestly we just clicked instantly
                  jod super random!😭 like everyday casual talk, sungog2, bullying duh bully since highschool 
                  and its funny bcs u knew na noun nga na crush tika way back then, pero pasikat man ka, happy crush rajod to oy until college
                  with no intention of confessing or what, wara admiring you from afar ang atake. But then super random somwhere in April min reply kas akoa note (crush pod ko nimo no?)
                  idk if trip rato nimo or bored raka but it all started there hantod sa everday nata nag talk, but wala ko nag expect na we would click and actually get to know each
                  other more, celebrate birthdays, christmans, new year, and now valentines, nagpa reto pa gali ka ako pod na pa as if na supportive (nasasaktan na pala eme), But im really glad 
                  that all of that led me to you, to us

                </p>
                
                <p>
                  I was so used to keeping my walls up, putting a strong facade being a gangsta, na I actually forgot how to be affectionate, soft and feminine,
                  but with you I can be all of that (may tombits side pa rin) as months passed by I became more expressive, I started showing affection
                  at first I was really holding back, its not that I dont like you, it was just I was afraid nga masakitan nasab ko, but now? how can I not fall for you,you held me so gently, so secure that for the longest time 
                  I geniunely feel safe around someone, I can be ME around you, you have a beautiful sweet soul Karl,
                  the way you handle things, how your mind works, your goofiness and how you make me laugh even on days that I dont feel like smiling. You remind 
                  me of the color yellow. You are my yellow, the kind of love that doesn't burn but feels warm and safe.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  It amazes me bcs everytime na we have misunderstandings or any conflicts you handle it so calmly, you listned and payed attention,
                  you made me feel like my feelings are valid, for the first time someone finally makes me feel seen, heard and trluy loved, 
                  Thank you for that baby I'm vv glad to have you and the privilege to love you, you are truly a blessing. 
                  Love is a choice and I will gladly choose you any day of the week, as the song goes
                  "I'd love to figure love out with you", whatever the future may hold, I want it to be with you, I want to grow with you, ill stay through every challenge we may face, 
                  Thank you for showing me what real love really is 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To the one who always make my heart feel safe and happy,Happy Valentines! Iloveeeyou so muchieee! mwa!❤️
